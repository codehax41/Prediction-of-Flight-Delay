# Prediction-of-Flight-Delay
Data Description
Flight delays are obviously frustrating to air travellers and costly to airlines. Airline companies are the most important customers of the airport. A well-known phrase ‘the airplane earns only when flying’ holds true. On-time performance of airlines schedule is a key factor in maintaining current customer satisfaction and attracting new ones. Flight schedule of the airport is the key to planning and executing airlines’ operation. With each schedule, the airline defines its daily operations and commits its resources to satisfy its customers’ air travel needs. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Studies have identified the stages of flight in which delays occur and the causal factors that result in delays. 
This Data Set describes Delta Airlines Inc (DL) on-Time Statistics Report of Departures from  Dallas Fort Worth and New York. and the different stages where the delay occurs has been captured.
Problem Statement
The company is keen to understand the key factors through visualisation that cause the delay and predict the possibility of delay in the future.
There are two datasets  :
1.	Train Dataset -   January 2016 through January 2017 
2.	Test Dataset - January 2018 
Data Dictionary:
Column Name 	Description
Carrier Code	Code of the Carrier
Date (MM/DD/YYYY)	Date of the flight
Flight Number	Flight number
Tail Number	An aircraft registration number 
Destination Airport	Code of Destination Airport 
Scheduled departure time	Departure time as per the Schedule
Actual departure time	Actual departure time
Scheduled elapsed time (Minutes)	Elapsed time is the time the aircraft is airborne
Actual elapsed time (Minutes)	Actual time is the time the aircraft is airborne
Departure delay (Minutes)	Total Delay in departture
Wheels-off time	Time when the wheels were off the ground
Taxi-Out time (Minutes)	Time taken for the aircraft to push back / vacate the parking position to the actual take off
Delay Carrier (Minutes)	Carrier delay is within the control of the air carrier. Examples of occurrences that may determine carrier delay are: aircraft cleaning, aircraft damage, awaiting the arrival of connecting passengers or crew, baggage, bird strike, cargo loading, catering, computer, outage-carrier equipment, crew legality (pilot or attendant rest), damage by hazardous goods, engineering inspection, fueling, handling disabled passengers, late crew, lavatory servicing, maintenance, oversales, potable water servicing, removal of unruly passenger, slow boarding or seating, stowing carry-on baggage, weight and balance delays.
Delay Weather (Minutes)	Weather delay is caused by extreme or hazardous weather conditions that are forecasted or manifest themselves on point of departure.
Delay National Aviation System (Minutes)	Delay that is within the control of the National Airspace System (NAS) may include: non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, air traffic control, etc.
Delay Security (Minutes)	Security delay is caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas
Delay Late Aircraft Arrival (Minutes)	Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. This causes a ripple effect
